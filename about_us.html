            <h2>How are we different</h2>

            <div class="difference-card">
                <h3>Faster Recovery through Admission Facility</h3>
                <p>Neurologically affected patients may take longer for recovery. It is only possible to take 2/3/4
                    treatment sessions per day in a Physiotherapy admission facility like ours. With multiple sessions
                    per day, with each session focusing on a different problem (like walking, Balance training,
                    cognitive rehabilitation, Hand strengthening, etc), the patient will recover faster with improvement
                    in various domains all at once.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="difference-card">
                <h3>Multispeciality Collaborative Approach:</h3>
                <p>Patients often get confused with different opinions coming from different specialists. At The Rehab
                    House, the Rehabilitation team including the Physical, Cognitive, Occupational , Speech Therapists,
                    the Neurologist, the Orthotist, the Dietician and the Psychologist work together to give a unified
                    care plan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="difference-card">
                <h3>Making Caregiving Easy</h3>
                <p>Medical Conditions & Aging ring our bells and say 'Surprise!'. The family members and the caregivers
                    are never prepared for this change. At The Rehab House, the caregivers get an insight of how to
                    handle the patients, how to transfer/ dress/ motivate them. With the help of the support staff at
                    The Rehab House, the sudden physical burden imposed on the family member is reduced and they can
                    become emotionally and socially more available to take care of the patient well.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="difference-card">
                <h3>All Services under one roof</h3>
                <p>Patients are often seen travelling from one place to another to seek consultations, treatments, blood
                    tests, xrays, and other diagnostic tests. The Rehab House is a one stop solution with all the
                    specialists and services available for the patient at one place.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="difference-card">
                <h3>Specialized Rehabilitation Programs</h3>
                <p>We do understand that this long journey of recovery can be boring. At The Rehab House, with our
                    innovative and creative treatment strategies we assure better engagement and motivation for our
                    patients.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="difference-card">
                <h3>Discharge Protocol for a Smooth Transition</h3>
                <p>We believe Physiotherapy is a form of Medical Treatment and not a wellness program. And so, at The
                    Rehab House, we aim at giving multiple treatment sessions per day for a faster recovery and a
                    shorter hospitalisation stay, making it economically, socially and emotionally easier for the
                    patient to get back to normalcy. We believe our patients must become independent soon and move ahead
                    in their lives after getting treated and discharged from The Rehab House.</p>
