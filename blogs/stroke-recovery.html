            <p>Recovering from a stroke is a journey that requires patience, consistency, and the right approach. While
                professional rehabilitation is crucial, what you do at home matters just as much. At <a
                    href="../index.html">The Rehab House in South Mumbai</a>, we emphasize a holistic approach.</p>

            <h3>1. Repetition is Key</h3>
            <p>Neuroplasticity—the brain's ability to rewire itself—relies on repetition. Repeat your prescribed
                exercises daily.</p>

            <h3>2. Focus on "Affected" Side</h3>
            <p>Try to use your weaker hand or leg as much as possible safely. This encourages the brain to reconnect
                with those muscles.</p>

            <h3>3. Stay Active</h3>
            <p>Avoid staying in bed all day. Sit up, stand, or walk with assistance to maintain muscle tone.</p>

    <!-- Adjust paths in header_footer.js if needed? 
         WAIT: header_footer.js has hardcoded links like "index.html". 
         If loaded from "blogs/blog-1.html", links will break (look for blogs/index.html).
         We need absolute paths or logic in js/header_footer.js to handle depth.

        // Quick fix for relative paths in header/footer for this subfolder
        // Actually, easiest is to just use "../" prefix for links if we detect we are in a subfolder?
        // Or updated header_footer.js to use absolute paths (e.g. /index.html).
        // Since it's file://, absolute paths might be tricky.
        // Let's stick to simple relative links correction script.
