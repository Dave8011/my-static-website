            <p>With more people working from home, back pain has become a common complaint. Simple ergonomic adjustments
                can make a world of difference.</p>

            <h3>1. Chair Height</h3>
            <p>Adjust your chair so your feet rest flat on the floor or a footrest and your thighs are parallel to the
                floor.</p>

            <h3>2. Monitor Position</h3>
            <p>Place your monitor about an arm's length away, with the top of the screen at or slightly below eye level.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Take Breaks</h3>
            <p>The 20-20-20 rule isn't just for eyes. Move every 20 minutes to prevent muscle stiffness.</p>
